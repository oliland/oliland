Like ironing my shirts or fixing the mountain of broken electronics
I've piled up, getting a blog together has been on my to-do list
for some time. Here are some general tips for anyone who struggles
to find the motivation to spice up their internet life:

* Take time out. Treat it like any other project with a deadline.
* Content is king, not the back-end. All this place does is serve
markdown documents. What's your blog gonna do, kill people?
* Speaking of overkill, ask yourself if you really need to use that
multi-user framework with a database. Have you met
[Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/)?
* Enjoy it. Use the tools you love, or hell; learn new ones if you
fancy it. You should work to a deadline, but that don't mean it can't
be fun. Or handsome.
* By all means, use a blogging platform like Tumblr or Wordpress.
Just don't expect to theme it. Looking good is important for me, so I
went in the other direction.
* Likewise, don't expect to be too popular if you don't use a platform.
I probably won't put comments in, but if I write a technical article
and someone adds important information, I'll be sure to update the article
& credit them.
