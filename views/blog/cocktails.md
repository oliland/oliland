# Cocktails
### First published 29<sup>th</sup> November 2011

A friend and I decided to make cocktails in my kitchen. These are the results:

## Raspberry Smoothie

* 2cl Dark Rum
* 2cl Chambord
* Handful of raspberries
* Mint
* Sugar
* Dash of lime juice

Pulp the raspberries with the sugar, mint and lime. Add 6 teaspoons of pulp with plenty of ice, the rum and chambord, and shake well.
Strain through a sieve. Glassware should be martini.

_Review:_ Don't be fooled by it's enchanting red glow; there's no innocence in this smoothie.

## White Pirate

* 4cl Baileys
* 2cl Dark Rum
* 2cl Tia Maria

Pour over ice in a tumbler.

_Review:_ Abandon the creamy wastelands of Moscow and charter a darker ship towards the Carribean. This delicious grog takes no prisoners.

## Classy Oli
* Handful of Blueberries
* Sugar
* Half rum
* Half chambord

Pulp the blueberries with sugar and put it all in a shaker with ice. Sieve.

_Review:_ Looks like cat sick but tasty enough to drink (just like me?)

## Tai Tai
* Lots of strawberries
* Sugar
* Lots of gin
* Something else

Pump the strawberries with sugar and ad gin until it's drinkable.

_Review:_ We were pretty fucked by this point.

Most of these were the brainchild of [mennenia](http://mennenia.com/) who brilliantly suggested this alternative night in.
